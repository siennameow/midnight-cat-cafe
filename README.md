## Installation

To run a local development copy, you are required to have installed 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/). 

Download the repository. After downloading run `npm run install` in the root 
directory of the repository. It is also recommended for you to run 
`npm run seed` in order to seed your mongo database with some dummy data for
events. 

Once those are done, you can see the development environemnt by running 
`npm run develop` in the root directory. This will start two Node.js servers,
one running react, the other running an express server that uses Apollo Graphql
to serve as the back end. They are on `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001` 
respectively.

## Usage

The app itself acts like a website for a small store-front cafe. There tabs for
the menu, purchasing merchandise, events, and making an account to sign up for
said events. 

The Menu is simply a display of drinks and food items a cafe might sell, with
prices that are semi-reasonable. They also have images that can be dismissed by 
clicking/tapping on the red X in the upper left hand corner. 

The Merch tab has ficitonal cat products to buy as well. Unlike the 
menu we've put in a fake "buy now" interface that uses 
[stripe](https://stripe.com/) as a payment system. 

The Events are events linked to the cafe. They are held inside the database and
hold a list of users as the people who will frequent the event. 

It works by using graphQL to send requests and responses to the database and 
it updates as appropriate.
